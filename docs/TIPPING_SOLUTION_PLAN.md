5. **Settlement**: Direct deposit to streamer's ApeChain wallet address

### Settlement Configuration
- **Thresholds**: Customizable minimum amounts for settlement
- **Scheduling**: Daily, weekly, or threshold-based settlements
- **Gas Optimization**: Batch processing to minimize transaction costs
- **Failure Handling**: Automatic retry logic with fallback mechanisms
